## Updates

Shows your version and whether a newer one is available.

- **Check now** checks straight away.
- When an update is available you'll see **What's new**, plus **Download**, **Release page** and **Skip this version**.
- After downloading: **Install and restart** on Windows, or **Open the disk image** on a Mac.
- **Check for updates automatically** looks once a day, shortly after Crater opens. It never downloads or installs anything by itself. On by default.

See [Updating Crater](/docs/getting-started/installation#updating-crater).

## Diagnostics

**Send logs to developer** sends Crater's recent log to the developer when something has gone wrong. Add a note in **What went wrong?** to explain what happened.

The log lists file names and paths from your media library and a record of recent activity in the app. It doesn't contain passwords. Nothing is sent unless you click the button.
